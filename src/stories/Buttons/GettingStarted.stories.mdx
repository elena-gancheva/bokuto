# Getting Started with the KendoReact Buttons

#### This guide provides essential information about using the KendoReact Buttons package&mdash;you will learn how to install the Buttons package, add a Button component to your project, style the component, and activate your license.

After completing this guide, you will be able to reproduce the following example.


## Setting Up Your React Project

Before you install the KendoReact Buttons, make sure that you have a running React project. The easiest way to set up a React project is to use the [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) approach that is described in the [Get Started with KendoReact] article.




## Installing the Components


All KendoReact packages are distributed through npm and offer a similar installation experience. To use any of the components in the Buttons package, start with the installation of the npm package and its [dependencies](#toc-dependencies). Use Node.js v5.0.0 or later.

```sh
npm install --save @progress/kendo-react-buttons @progress/kendo-svg-icons @progress/kendo-licensing
```



## Importing the Component

After installing the Buttons npm package, import the desired components in the React App. This guide shows how to add the Button.

In the App component file of your React project (for example, `src/App.js`), add the following code:

```jsx-no-run
// ES2015 module syntax
import { Button } from '@progress/kendo-react-buttons';
```
```jsx-no-run
// CommonJS format
const { Button } = require('@progress/kendo-react-buttons');
```

If your project requires more components from the Buttons package, you can import them too. The package provides the following components:

* Button
* ButtonGroup
* Chip
* ChipList
* DropDownButton
* FloatingActionButton
* Toolbar
* SplitButton




## Using the Component

1. After installing the Buttons package and importing the components, add the Button tags to the App component file of your React project (for example, `src/App.js`).

   ```jsx-no-run
   <Button>My Button</Button>
   ```

1. Optionally, handle the `onClick` event by adding a `ButtonContainer` and then defining the action that occurs when the Button generates the `onClick` event.

   ```jsx-no-run
   const ButtonContainer = () => {
      const handleButtonClick = () => {
         console.log("click");
         alert("KendoReact Button was clicked.");
      }
         return (
            <div>
               <Button onClick={handleButtonClick}>
               My Button
               </Button>
            </div>
         );
   }
   ReactDOM.render(
   <ButtonContainer />,
      document.querySelector('my-app')
   );
   ```

1. To style the Button, install and import the [Default theme](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-react-ui/components/styling/theme-default/), which is one of the [three beautiful themes](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-react-ui/components/styling/) for KendoReact.

   2.1. Install the Default theme package.

      ```sh
      npm install --save @progress/kendo-theme-default
      ```

   2.2. Import the CSS file from the package in `src/App.js`. Add this import before your existing `App.css` import.

      ```jsx-no-run
      import '@progress/kendo-theme-default/dist/all.css';
      ```

1. Build and run the application by typing the following command in the root folder of your project:

   ```sh
   npm start
   ```



## Activating Your License Key

Using any of the UI components in the KendoReact library requires either a commercial license key or an active trial license key.

Follow the instructions on the KendoReact [My License page](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-react-ui/components/my-license/) to activate your trial or commercial license. You can skip this step if your application already contains a KendoReact license file.



## Dependencies

The Buttons package requires you to install the following [peer dependencies](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/npm/peer-dependencies/) in your application:
